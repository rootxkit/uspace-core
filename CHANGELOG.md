# Changelog

All notable changes to `uspace-core`. The format follows Keep a Changelog;
versions follow spec `00 §6.3`: within a major only additive changes; a
behavioural change to a judgement is a major even when the Go signature is
unchanged, and ships with the changed vector and the regulation or standard
clause behind it; two majors are maintained in parallel for six months.

Each entry names the work package and the vectors it affects.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Plan and scaffolding: `docs/PLAN.md`, work package briefs, frozen base
  types in `core`, frozen ODID message types, the `vectors` harness with
  the 16 knowledge vector files (596 cases) vendored from
  `uspace-lab@c6b7f33` (generated from `utm@484cd22`), CI, lint and
  Makefile. [WP-0]
